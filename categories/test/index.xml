To be dependent on something means that its absence causes suffering. If you&amp;rsquo;re dependent on a drug, a substance, or even a person, then your well-being is no longer entirely within your own control. You are not free. From this perspective, avoiding dependence becomes not just practical, but ethical: it is a step toward greater autonomy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yet in some contexts, dependence is idealized. Popular culture, for instance, romanticizes the idea of being unable to live without someone else—as if love were more authentic when it involves emotional or existential dependence. On closer inspection, however, this ideal can become problematic. Would it not be more empowering, more resilient, and perhaps even more loving, to be able to say: &lt;em>I can live well without you—but I choose to live with you&lt;/em>?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Liberty</title><link>https://institutionengineering.com/posts/liberty/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 07:44:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://institutionengineering.com/posts/liberty/</guid><description>&lt;p>Liberty is a foundational value in democratic societies. But what does it truly mean, and how should it be protected in a complex, interconnected world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>On Liberty&lt;/em>, &lt;strong>John Stuart Mill&lt;/strong> offers a compelling defense of individual freedom. For Mill, liberty is essential because it enables &lt;strong>learning, growth, and progress&lt;/strong>. He argues that our beliefs, behaviors, and ideas should be constantly tested against alternatives. Without the freedom to think differently, speak freely, and live according to one&amp;rsquo;s own values, we lose the ability to refine our understanding of truth—and with it, the capacity to improve as individuals and as a society.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Criticsim</title><link>https://institutionengineering.com/posts/criticism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 07:44:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://institutionengineering.com/posts/criticism/</guid><description>&lt;p>Among the many principles that shape both personal development and the evolution of societies, &lt;strong>criticism&lt;/strong> plays a particularly valuable role. It is a powerful tool for learning—not just in academic research or science, but in everyday life and in the design of social institutions. This post explores why embracing criticism is important, how it can be beneficial rather than harmful, and what institutional arrangements can help make space for it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principles for a Constitution</title><link>https://institutionengineering.com/posts/constitution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 07:44:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://institutionengineering.com/posts/constitution/</guid><description>&lt;p>In many democratic and wealthy countries, &lt;em>democracy&lt;/em> is widely valued. Yet, what exactly is meant by democracy is not always clear. Is it simply the rule of the majority? Or is it something more nuanced?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the Munich Security Conference in 2025, the U.S. Vice President criticized parts of Europe for what he considered a “lack of democracy,” pointing to cases like alleged election manipulation in Romania or the legal and institutional challenges faced by right-wing parties such as the AfD in Germany. His remarks seemed to imply a majoritarian understanding of democracy—that democratic legitimacy comes primarily from aligning with the will of the majority.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
