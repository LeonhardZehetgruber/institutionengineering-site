In many democratic and wealthy countries, *democracy* is widely valued. Yet, what exactly is meant by democracy is not always clear. Is it simply the rule of the majority? Or is it something more nuanced?

At the Munich Security Conference in 2025, the U.S. Vice President criticized parts of Europe for what he considered a “lack of democracy,” pointing to cases like alleged election manipulation in Romania or the legal and institutional challenges faced by right-wing parties such as the AfD in Germany. His remarks seemed to imply a majoritarian understanding of democracy—that democratic legitimacy comes primarily from aligning with the will of the majority.

However, this understanding raises deep philosophical and practical concerns.

### The Problem of "Who Should Rule?"

As **Karl Popper** argued in *The Open Society and Its Enemies*, the fundamental political question is often framed incorrectly. Asking “who should rule?” assumes that any group or individual should be granted unchecked authority. Popper suggests instead that we should design institutions that minimize the damage that rulers can do—regardless of who they are. The real question becomes: *How can we prevent power from being used arbitrarily and destructively?*

Democracy as the rule of the majority may sound appealing, but it can paradoxically lead to the *abolition of democracy itself*. For instance, a majority could vote to concentrate power in the hands of a dictator. This echoes the **paradox of freedom**: if absolute freedom allows people to enslave themselves or others, then freedom itself is destroyed.

A well-designed constitution, therefore, must *limit* the scope of majoritarian rule. It must contain principles that **prevent any group—including the majority—from having unchecked power**, especially power over others’ fundamental rights and freedoms.

### Liberty and the Limits of Majority Rule

**John Stuart Mill**, in *On Liberty*, warns against what he calls the “tyranny of the majority.” Even in democratic systems, majorities can impose their preferences, beliefs, and ways of life on minorities. Mill argues for a clear distinction between *self-regarding actions* and *other-regarding actions*. Individuals should be free to live as they choose unless their actions directly harm others.

This means that laws protecting minorities—whether ethnic, religious, or political—are not exceptions to democracy but essential components of a just democratic order. A constitution must ensure liberty for all, not just the prevailing majority.

### Avoiding Arbitrary Power

This concern is not new. Already in the 17th century, **John Locke** emphasized in *Two Treatises of Government* that a legitimate political order must avoid granting arbitrary power. Locke believed in a government with *limited powers*, operating under the rule of law, and accountable to the people.

Some may argue for *anarchy* as a solution—if no one rules, there can be no oppression. But history and political theory suggest that anarchy often leads to a “state of nature,” where the strong dominate the weak. This too is a form of arbitrary power, just without formal institutions.

Instead, **the challenge is to design institutions that distribute power carefully, that prevent domination from any quarter, and that preserve individual freedoms while maintaining collective order**.

### Principles to Consider

Based on these ideas, here are some principles that could serve as the foundation for a constitution:

* **Rule of Law**: No one is above the law—not individuals, not groups, not even the majority.
* **Checks and Balances**: Power must be divided and constrained to prevent abuse.
* **Protection of Minorities**: Rights and liberties of minorities must be upheld even against majority preferences.
* **Transparency and Accountability**: Institutions must be visible and answerable to the public.
* **Freedom with Boundaries**: Individual liberty should be maximized as long as it does not infringe on the liberty of others.
* **Prevention of Arbitrary Power**: No group, including the majority, should be able to impose unchecked authority.

These principles, rather than a simplistic majoritarianism, offer a more robust and sustainable vision of democracy—one that preserves both liberty and stability.
