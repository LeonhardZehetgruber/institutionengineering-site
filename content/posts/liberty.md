## Liberty

Liberty is a foundational value in democratic societies. But what does it truly mean, and how should it be protected in a complex, interconnected world?

In *On Liberty*, **John Stuart Mill** offers a compelling defense of individual freedom. For Mill, liberty is essential because it enables **learning, growth, and progress**. He argues that our beliefs, behaviors, and ideas should be constantly tested against alternatives. Without the freedom to think differently, speak freely, and live according to one's own values, we lose the ability to refine our understanding of truth—and with it, the capacity to improve as individuals and as a society.

### Liberty and Harm

Mill famously draws a line: liberty extends until the point where one’s actions begin to **harm others**. In his time, examples like smoking or crossing a dangerous bridge might have seemed like purely personal choices. But in the context of a **modern social welfare state**, these acts often have broader consequences. Today, when someone suffers the effects of long-term smoking or is injured due to reckless behavior, public resources—financed by taxpayers—are typically used for their care.

This doesn't invalidate Mill’s principle. It **shifts the context** in which we apply it. The idea that individuals should be free to make personal decisions remains powerful—but we must acknowledge that the **scope of individual impact** has changed. In a society where health care, rescue services, and basic welfare are publicly funded, personal choices can, and often do, affect others indirectly.

### The Principle in Practice

Mill’s defense of liberty remains an essential guide. It supports freedom in **religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, language, and lifestyle**—domains where private expression typically does not harm others. Diversity in these areas enriches society, rather than threatens it.

Yet Mill's principle also allows us to draw a boundary when **ideas or behaviors infringe on the rights and dignity of others**. For example, if intolerant ideologies such as racism become widespread, they stop being just "opinions" and begin to **erode social cohesion and security**. In such cases, defending liberty requires us to take a stand against those who would deny freedom to others.

This is not a contradiction—it's a fulfillment of Mill's vision. Liberty includes the right to live free from fear, exclusion, or systemic discrimination.

### Institutional Responsibility and the Paradox of Liberty

A critical insight that follows from Mill’s work is what’s sometimes called the **paradox of liberty**: the freedom to give up freedom must be limited. People might choose to become dependent, submissive, or even enslaved—voluntarily. But a democratic society must protect against this. The state should ensure that **no one can take liberty away from another**, even with consent.

This also means supporting people in difficult circumstances. If someone becomes impoverished or excluded, the state should help them regain their autonomy—not only out of compassion, but as a way to **uphold liberty itself**. Freedom is not just the absence of restraint; it’s also about **real, available opportunities**.

### More Rules, More Liberty?

Contrary to a common assumption, **more rules do not always mean less freedom**. Rules that are fair, well-designed, and transparently enforced can actually **expand liberty**. Traffic laws, for instance, make roads safer and transport more accessible for everyone. A ban on public weapons may reduce individual choice—but it also creates a freer, more secure public space.

Likewise, when society invests in public infrastructure, such as a reliable railway network, it opens up new **choices and freedoms**—even though it requires collective funding. In this way, a **well-constructed welfare state** does not undermine liberty; it **enhances it**, especially for those who might otherwise be left without options.

### Liberty for All

Liberty should not only be preserved for the majority or the powerful. It must be **extended and ensured** for minorities, people with disabilities, and those at the margins of society—even if this requires effort and resources from the state. In doing so, we don’t just uphold an abstract ideal—we create a society in which **everyone has the real possibility to live freely**.

This understanding of liberty is both principled and pragmatic. It respects personal autonomy while recognizing our mutual responsibilities. It accepts that freedom is not merely what we are free *from*, but also what we are free *to do and become*.
