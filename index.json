[{"content":"In many democratic and wealthy countries, democracy is widely valued. Yet, what exactly is meant by democracy is not always clear. Is it simply the rule of the majority? Or is it something more nuanced?\nAt the Munich Security Conference in 2025, the U.S. Vice President criticized parts of Europe for what he considered a “lack of democracy,” pointing to cases like alleged election manipulation in Romania or the legal and institutional challenges faced by right-wing parties such as the AfD in Germany. His remarks seemed to imply a majoritarian understanding of democracy—that democratic legitimacy comes primarily from aligning with the will of the majority.\nHowever, this understanding raises deep philosophical and practical concerns.\nThe Problem of \u0026ldquo;Who Should Rule?\u0026rdquo; As Karl Popper argued in The Open Society and Its Enemies, the fundamental political question is often framed incorrectly. Asking “who should rule?” assumes that any group or individual should be granted unchecked authority. Popper suggests instead that we should design institutions that minimize the damage that rulers can do—regardless of who they are. The real question becomes: How can we prevent power from being used arbitrarily and destructively?\nDemocracy as the rule of the majority may sound appealing, but it can paradoxically lead to the abolition of democracy itself. For instance, a majority could vote to concentrate power in the hands of a dictator. This echoes the paradox of freedom: if absolute freedom allows people to enslave themselves or others, then freedom itself is destroyed.\nA well-designed constitution, therefore, must limit the scope of majoritarian rule. It must contain principles that prevent any group—including the majority—from having unchecked power, especially power over others’ fundamental rights and freedoms.\nLiberty and the Limits of Majority Rule John Stuart Mill, in On Liberty, warns against what he calls the “tyranny of the majority.” Even in democratic systems, majorities can impose their preferences, beliefs, and ways of life on minorities. Mill argues for a clear distinction between self-regarding actions and other-regarding actions. Individuals should be free to live as they choose unless their actions directly harm others.\nThis means that laws protecting minorities—whether ethnic, religious, or political—are not exceptions to democracy but essential components of a just democratic order. A constitution must ensure liberty for all, not just the prevailing majority.\nAvoiding Arbitrary Power This concern is not new. Already in the 17th century, John Locke emphasized in Two Treatises of Government that a legitimate political order must avoid granting arbitrary power. Locke believed in a government with limited powers, operating under the rule of law, and accountable to the people.\nSome may argue for anarchy as a solution—if no one rules, there can be no oppression. But history and political theory suggest that anarchy often leads to a “state of nature,” where the strong dominate the weak. This too is a form of arbitrary power, just without formal institutions.\nInstead, the challenge is to design institutions that distribute power carefully, prevent domination from any quarter, and preserve individual freedoms while maintaining collective order.\nThe Deeper Problem with Tyranny It is often said that power corrupts. Some believe this is the strongest argument against tyranny or dictatorship—that those who gain unchecked power eventually become bad people. This may indeed be true. There are several possible explanations: perhaps those drawn to absolute power are more likely to be reckless or self-interested in the first place. Or perhaps even people with good intentions are gradually changed by the temptations of absolute control.\nBut even this is not the most decisive argument against dictatorship. The real problem lies elsewhere: once power is handed over, everything depends on fortune. Even if today\u0026rsquo;s dictator is wise and benevolent, there is no guarantee that tomorrow’s will be. Even if the current ruler governs justly, there is nothing to prevent future abuse. It\u0026rsquo;s the same with freedom: a slave may have a kind master today, but they have no guarantee of kindness tomorrow. They have given away their freedom, and their fate now depends on the will of another.\nGood governance cannot rely on luck or hope—it must be built on structures that ensure freedom, accountability, and limits to power.\nPrinciples to Consider Based on these reflections, here are some principles that could serve as the foundation for a constitution:\nRule of Law: No one is above the law—not individuals, not groups, not even the majority. Checks and Balances: Power must be divided and constrained to prevent abuse. Protection of Minorities: Rights and liberties of minorities must be upheld even against majority preferences. Transparency and Accountability: Institutions must be visible and answerable to the public. Freedom with Boundaries: Individual liberty should be maximized as long as it does not infringe on the liberty of others. Prevention of Arbitrary Power: No group, including the majority, should be able to impose unchecked authority. These principles offer more than a formal structure—they are a safeguard against domination, a framework for sustainable freedom, and a commitment to the dignity of all.\n","permalink":"https://institutionengineering.com/posts/constitution/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn many democratic and wealthy countries, \u003cem\u003edemocracy\u003c/em\u003e is widely valued.

To be dependent on something means that its absence causes suffering. If you\u0026rsquo;re dependent on a drug, a substance, or even a person, then your well-being is no longer entirely within your own control. You are not free. From this perspective, avoiding dependence becomes not just practical, but ethical: it is a step toward greater autonomy.\nThe Illusion of Romantic Dependence Yet in some contexts, dependence is idealized. Popular culture, for instance, romanticizes the idea of being unable to live without someone else—as if love were more authentic when it involves emotional or existential dependence. On closer inspection, however, this ideal can become problematic. Would it not be more empowering, more resilient, and perhaps even more loving, to be able to say: I can live well without you—but I choose to live with you?\nTrue strength in a relationship may lie not in mutual dependence, but in mutual independence paired with voluntary commitment. Dependence can make us vulnerable not only to loss but to manipulation or abuse. A stronger model of love and friendship is one where individuals are whole on their own—and choose connection freely.\nThe Stoic Ideal: Benefiting Without Needing This idea resonates with a key insight from Stoic philosophy, particularly the writings of Seneca. The Stoics speak of “independence from fortune”—the ability to remain content regardless of external circumstances. But Seneca’s view is more subtle than a mere call for emotional detachment. He doesn’t say we should reject fortune; rather, we should enjoy good fortune without becoming dependent on it.\nHealth, wealth, and relationships are good things—we can enjoy them. But we should not stake our inner peace on their presence. If we lose them, we should not collapse. This is more than indifference; it’s a kind of psychological asymmetry: we benefit when things go well but are not destroyed when they don’t.\nFrom Stoicism to Antifragility A similar insight is developed in a different context by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, particularly in his concept of antifragility. Where the Stoics spoke about the soul, Taleb speaks about systems—financial, social, or personal. Antifragility is more than resilience (resisting shocks); it’s about gaining from disorder.\nTaleb gives the example of investing: if you place most of your money in very safe assets and a small portion in highly volatile, high-risk investments, you may be positioned to benefit disproportionately from rare but powerful events. Most of the time, the risky part might fail. But in the rare cases it succeeds, the upside can be large enough to outweigh the many small losses. This is possible because of fat tails in market distributions—a concept developed by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. In such distributions, extreme events have a higher probability and greater impact than traditional models assume.\nThis strategy—sometimes called a barbell strategy—mirrors the Stoic principle: be robust against downside while remaining open to upside. You are not only independent of bad fortune—you benefit from volatility. That is antifragility.\nA Way of Living In everyday life, we can apply this logic beyond philosophy and finance. For example:\nIf your happiness depends entirely on your job, you are vulnerable. But if you cultivate varied interests and supportive relationships, you are more resilient—or even antifragile. If you invest emotionally only in things you can control, while remaining open to the benefits of what you cannot, you gain peace without stagnation. We might say, then, that the ideal is not just to avoid dependence, but to build lives and systems that gain from stress and change—to become not fragile, not even merely robust, but antifragile.\n","permalink":"https://institutionengineering.com/posts/independence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDependence\u003c/strong\u003e is often seen—rightly—as an undesirable state.

But what does it truly mean, and how should it be protected in a complex, interconnected world?\nIn On Liberty, John Stuart Mill offers a compelling defense of individual freedom. For Mill, liberty is essential because it enables learning, growth, and progress. He argues that our beliefs, behaviors, and ideas should be constantly tested against alternatives. Without the freedom to think differently, speak freely, and live according to one\u0026rsquo;s own values, we lose the ability to refine our understanding of truth—and with it, the capacity to improve as individuals and as a society.\nLiberty and Harm Mill famously draws a line: liberty extends until the point where one’s actions begin to harm others. In his time, examples like smoking or crossing a dangerous bridge might have seemed like purely personal choices. But in the context of a modern social welfare state, these acts often have broader consequences. Today, when someone suffers the effects of long-term smoking or is injured due to reckless behavior, public resources—financed by taxpayers—are typically used for their care.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t invalidate Mill’s principle. It shifts the context in which we apply it. The idea that individuals should be free to make personal decisions remains powerful—but we must acknowledge that the scope of individual impact has changed. In a society where health care, rescue services, and basic welfare are publicly funded, personal choices can, and often do, affect others indirectly.\nThe Principle in Practice Mill’s defense of liberty remains an essential guide. It supports freedom in religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, language, and lifestyle—domains where private expression typically does not harm others. Diversity in these areas enriches society, rather than threatens it.\nYet Mill\u0026rsquo;s principle also allows us to draw a boundary when ideas or behaviors infringe on the rights and dignity of others. For example, if intolerant ideologies such as racism become widespread, they stop being just \u0026ldquo;opinions\u0026rdquo; and begin to erode social cohesion and security. In such cases, defending liberty requires us to take a stand against those who would deny freedom to others.\nThis is not a contradiction—it\u0026rsquo;s a fulfillment of Mill\u0026rsquo;s vision. Liberty includes the right to live free from fear, exclusion, or systemic discrimination.\nInstitutional Responsibility and the Paradox of Liberty A critical insight is what’s sometimes called the paradox of liberty: the freedom to give up freedom must be limited. People might choose to become dependent, submissive, or even enslaved—voluntarily. But a democratic society must protect against this. The state should ensure that no one can take liberty away from another, even with consent.\nThis also means supporting people in difficult circumstances. If someone becomes impoverished or excluded, the state should help them regain their autonomy—not only out of compassion, but as a way to uphold liberty itself. Freedom is not just the absence of restraint; it’s also about real, available opportunities.\nMore Rules, More Liberty? Contrary to a common assumption, more rules do not always mean less freedom. Rules that are fair, well-designed, and transparently enforced can actually expand liberty. Traffic laws, for instance, make roads safer and transport more accessible for everyone. A ban on public weapons may reduce individual choice—but it also creates a freer, more secure public space.\nLikewise, when society invests in public infrastructure, such as a reliable railway network, it opens up new choices and freedoms—even though it requires collective funding. In this way, a well-constructed welfare state does not undermine liberty; it enhances it, especially for those who might otherwise be left without options.\nLiberty for All Liberty should not only be preserved for the majority or the powerful. It must be extended and ensured for minorities, people with disabilities, and those at the margins of society—even if this requires effort and resources from the state. In doing so, we don’t just uphold an abstract ideal—we create a society in which everyone has the real possibility to live freely.\nThis understanding of liberty is both principled and pragmatic. It respects personal autonomy while recognizing our mutual responsibilities. It accepts that freedom is not merely what we are free from, but also what we are free to do and become.\nReferences Mill, John Stuart. On Liberty. London: John W. Parker and Son, 1859.

It is a powerful tool for learning—not just in academic research or science, but in everyday life and in the design of social institutions. This post explores why embracing criticism is important, how it can be beneficial rather than harmful, and what institutional arrangements can help make space for it.\nCriticism and Learning At its core, learning involves testing ideas and adjusting when they don’t work. In The Logic of Scientific Discovery, Karl Popper outlined a model of scientific progress based on the formulation of hypotheses, rigorous testing, and the possibility of falsification. This approach makes criticism central to knowledge: when a hypothesis is falsified, it is either modified or replaced, and through this process, science advances.\nBut this model doesn’t only apply to research. The same principle shows up in daily life. When we try out a new strategy, routine, or recipe, we are testing an idea about what might work. If it fails, we can reflect, criticize our own approach, and adapt.\nCriticism in Everyday Life A key insight is that criticism does not have to be threatening. With the right mindset, it becomes something we can profit from rather than something we need to defend against. The same observation can hold whether the criticism is fair, unfair, kindly stated, or blunt.\nConsider an example: You usually live a healthy lifestyle—eating well, exercising regularly. One day, you eat an unhealthy snack, and someone who doesn’t live as healthily points out that what you\u0026rsquo;re eating is bad for you. It might feel unfair. Your instinct might be to justify your actions or criticize the other person. But if you treat criticism as a chance to reflect, it becomes something useful rather than something hurtful. You can calmly assess whether you want to adjust your behavior or not. Either way, you benefit from having considered it.\nThis kind of mental habit—welcoming feedback, not needing to defend yourself, using every critical moment as a learning opportunity—is a powerful personal principle. It creates more stability, less reactivity, and a stronger sense of agency.\nInstitutionalizing Criticism Importantly, criticism is not just a private attitude. It can be encouraged—or discouraged—by institutions. In a healthy society, institutions don’t just allow criticism; they actively facilitate it.\nThis can happen in many ways, for example:\nEducation: Teaching children how to give and receive criticism constructively helps build a culture of critical thinking. Feedback mechanisms: Governments, organizations, and communities can offer structured ways for people to voice concerns, evaluate performance, and propose improvements. Transparency: Perhaps the most powerful institutional support for criticism is transparency. When actions, decisions, and processes are visible, they become testable. This is similar to falsifiability in science: transparency allows others to spot errors, suggest alternatives, and hold systems accountable. In short, transparency makes institutions criticizable—and therefore improvable. An institution that hides its workings cannot learn. One that is open and encourages scrutiny can evolve.\nA Culture of Correction This is also why freedom of speech, pluralism, and public discourse are so vital. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill made a compelling case for why a great diversity of opinions should be allowed: because the clash of perspectives helps refine the truth. He argued that our judgments are trustworthy only if we keep the means for correcting them constantly available.\nThis is as true for societies as it is for individuals. When institutions invite criticism, they allow for error correction at the structural level. This makes them more resilient, more just, and more effective over time.\nCriticism of this website This website was created, in part, to make ideas testable and criticizable. I hope to develop and improve theories related to institutional design—and for that, I rely on your feedback. Criticism, both thoughtful and sharp, is what allows any system of thought to grow stronger.\nSo, thank you in advance—for reading critically, responding honestly, and helping refine what this project aims to become.\nReferences Popper, Karl.
