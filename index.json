[{"content":"Liberty Liberty is a foundational value in democratic societies. But what does it truly mean, and how should it be protected in a complex, interconnected world?\nIn On Liberty, John Stuart Mill offers a compelling defense of individual freedom. For Mill, liberty is essential because it enables learning, growth, and progress. He argues that our beliefs, behaviors, and ideas should be constantly tested against alternatives. Without the freedom to think differently, speak freely, and live according to one\u0026rsquo;s own values, we lose the ability to refine our understanding of truth—and with it, the capacity to improve as individuals and as a society.\nLiberty and Harm Mill famously draws a line: liberty extends until the point where one’s actions begin to harm others. In his time, examples like smoking or crossing a dangerous bridge might have seemed like purely personal choices. But in the context of a modern social welfare state, these acts often have broader consequences. Today, when someone suffers the effects of long-term smoking or is injured due to reckless behavior, public resources—financed by taxpayers—are typically used for their care.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t invalidate Mill’s principle. It shifts the context in which we apply it. The idea that individuals should be free to make personal decisions remains powerful—but we must acknowledge that the scope of individual impact has changed. In a society where health care, rescue services, and basic welfare are publicly funded, personal choices can, and often do, affect others indirectly.\nThe Principle in Practice Mill’s defense of liberty remains an essential guide. It supports freedom in religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, language, and lifestyle—domains where private expression typically does not harm others. Diversity in these areas enriches society, rather than threatens it.\nYet Mill\u0026rsquo;s principle also allows us to draw a boundary when ideas or behaviors infringe on the rights and dignity of others. For example, if intolerant ideologies such as racism become widespread, they stop being just \u0026ldquo;opinions\u0026rdquo; and begin to erode social cohesion and security. In such cases, defending liberty requires us to take a stand against those who would deny freedom to others.\nThis is not a contradiction—it\u0026rsquo;s a fulfillment of Mill\u0026rsquo;s vision. Liberty includes the right to live free from fear, exclusion, or systemic discrimination.\nInstitutional Responsibility and the Paradox of Liberty A critical insight is what’s sometimes called the paradox of liberty: the freedom to give up freedom must be limited. People might choose to become dependent, submissive, or even enslaved—voluntarily. But a democratic society must protect against this. The state should ensure that no one can take liberty away from another, even with consent.\nThis also means supporting people in difficult circumstances. If someone becomes impoverished or excluded, the state should help them regain their autonomy—not only out of compassion, but as a way to uphold liberty itself. Freedom is not just the absence of restraint; it’s also about real, available opportunities.\nMore Rules, More Liberty? Contrary to a common assumption, more rules do not always mean less freedom. Rules that are fair, well-designed, and transparently enforced can actually expand liberty. Traffic laws, for instance, make roads safer and transport more accessible for everyone. A ban on public weapons may reduce individual choice—but it also creates a freer, more secure public space.\nLikewise, when society invests in public infrastructure, such as a reliable railway network, it opens up new choices and freedoms—even though it requires collective funding. In this way, a well-constructed welfare state does not undermine liberty; it enhances it, especially for those who might otherwise be left without options.\nLiberty for All Liberty should not only be preserved for the majority or the powerful. It must be extended and ensured for minorities, people with disabilities, and those at the margins of society—even if this requires effort and resources from the state. In doing so, we don’t just uphold an abstract ideal—we create a society in which everyone has the real possibility to live freely.\nThis understanding of liberty is both principled and pragmatic. It respects personal autonomy while recognizing our mutual responsibilities. It accepts that freedom is not merely what we are free from, but also what we are free to do and become.\nReferences Mill, John Stuart. On Liberty. London: John W. Parker and Son, 1859.

It is a powerful tool for learning—not just in academic research or science, but in everyday life and in the design of social institutions. This post explores why embracing criticism is important, how it can be beneficial rather than harmful, and what institutional arrangements can help make space for it.\nCriticism and Learning At its core, learning involves testing ideas and adjusting when they don’t work. In The Logic of Scientific Discovery, Karl Popper outlined a model of scientific progress based on the formulation of hypotheses, rigorous testing, and the possibility of falsification. This approach makes criticism central to knowledge: when a hypothesis is falsified, it is either modified or replaced, and through this process, science advances.\nBut this model doesn’t only apply to research. The same principle shows up in daily life. When we try out a new strategy, routine, or recipe, we are testing an idea about what might work. If it fails, we can reflect, criticize our own approach, and adapt.\nCriticism in Everyday Life A key insight is that criticism does not have to be threatening. With the right mindset, it becomes something we can profit from rather than something we need to defend against. The same observation can hold whether the criticism is fair, unfair, kindly stated, or blunt.\nConsider an example: You usually live a healthy lifestyle—eating well, exercising regularly. One day, you eat an unhealthy snack, and someone who doesn’t live as healthily points out that what you\u0026rsquo;re eating is bad for you. It might feel unfair. Your instinct might be to justify your actions or criticize the other person. But if you treat criticism as a chance to reflect, it becomes something useful rather than something hurtful. You can calmly assess whether you want to adjust your behavior or not. Either way, you benefit from having considered it.\nThis kind of mental habit—welcoming feedback, not needing to defend yourself, using every critical moment as a learning opportunity—is a powerful personal principle. It creates more stability, less reactivity, and a stronger sense of agency.\nInstitutionalizing Criticism Importantly, criticism is not just a private attitude. It can be encouraged—or discouraged—by institutions. In a healthy society, institutions don’t just allow criticism; they actively facilitate it.\nThis can happen in many ways, for example:\nEducation: Teaching children how to give and receive criticism constructively helps build a culture of critical thinking. Feedback mechanisms: Governments, organizations, and communities can offer structured ways for people to voice concerns, evaluate performance, and propose improvements. Transparency: Perhaps the most powerful institutional support for criticism is transparency. When actions, decisions, and processes are visible, they become testable. This is similar to falsifiability in science: transparency allows others to spot errors, suggest alternatives, and hold systems accountable. In short, transparency makes institutions criticizable—and therefore improvable. An institution that hides its workings cannot learn. One that is open and encourages scrutiny can evolve.\nA Culture of Correction This is also why freedom of speech, pluralism, and public discourse are so vital. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill made a compelling case for why a great diversity of opinions should be allowed: because the clash of perspectives helps refine the truth. He argued that our judgments are trustworthy only if we keep the means for correcting them constantly available.\nThis is as true for societies as it is for individuals. When institutions invite criticism, they allow for error correction at the structural level. This makes them more resilient, more just, and more effective over time.\nCriticism of this website This website was created, in part, to make ideas testable and criticizable. I hope to develop and improve theories related to institutional design—and for that, I rely on your feedback. Criticism, both thoughtful and sharp, is what allows any system of thought to grow stronger.\nSo, thank you in advance—for reading critically, responding honestly, and helping refine what this project aims to become.\nReferences Popper, Karl.
