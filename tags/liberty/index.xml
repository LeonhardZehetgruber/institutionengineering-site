But what does it truly mean, and how should it be protected in a complex, interconnected world?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;em>On Liberty&lt;/em>, &lt;strong>John Stuart Mill&lt;/strong> offers a compelling defense of individual freedom. For Mill, liberty is essential because it enables &lt;strong>learning, growth, and progress&lt;/strong>. He argues that our beliefs, behaviors, and ideas should be constantly tested against alternatives. Without the freedom to think differently, speak freely, and live according to one&amp;rsquo;s own values, we lose the ability to refine our understanding of truthâ€”and with it, the capacity to improve as individuals and as a society.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
